I am currently a postdocal associate from [Department of Biostatistics, Yale University](https://ysph.yale.edu/public-health-research-and-practice/department-research/biostatistics/), and also a fellow in [Yale â€“ Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellowship](https://medicine.yale.edu/cbds/bdsfellowship/). 

My general interest lies in high-dimensional data analysis, particularlly focus on heterogeneity analysis and network analysis. My research interests also include bootstrap development, model uncertainty, and robust analysis. For applications, I am dedicated to applying the statistical learning to cancer heterogeneity, including cancer genotyping and immunotyping, to facilitate personal treatment and drug discovery.
